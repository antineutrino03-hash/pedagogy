# Miscellaneous Data Scraping and Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`misc_scraping.ipynb`) for data processing, interpolation, and curve fitting. The notebook reads CSV files, processes numerical data, applies interpolation techniques, and performs curve fitting using `lmfit`.

## Features

- Reads CSV files containing numerical data.
- Performs data transformations and scaling.
- Uses **SciPy** for linear interpolation.
- Implements **Lmfit** for curve fitting and optimization.
- Visualizes data using **Matplotlib**.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy lmfit
```

## Usage

- Load the Notebook
Open misc_scraping.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Prepare CSV Files
Update the file paths in the notebook to match the location of your CSV files.
Run the Notebook
Execute the notebook cells step by step to load, process, and visualize the data.
Modify and Customize
Adjust interpolation and curve fitting parameters as needed.
Output

The notebook generates interpolated data points.
Curve fitting results are displayed with parameter optimizations.
Visualizations include raw data plots and fitted curves.

## Contributing

Feel free to modify the notebook for different datasets or additional processing steps.
